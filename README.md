## Business Value

Marriott Hotel reviews could be found on company's official website, TripAdvisor, Expedia and many more online hotel-booking platforms. Potential new customers will browse these online reviews, and make the decision whether or not to book a room at the Marriott.

What if they have already made up their mind from hearing what a friend had said? Customers could be also influenced by others' opinions on social media, like a tweet or a facebook post. Understanding how people think about our hotel social media will bring us the general public's perception of our hotel.

By using sentiment analysis on existing hotel reviews scrapped from company's official website, I created a model that can quantify on a scale of 1-5, how the author of a tweet on twitter feels about our hotel, and as a consequence, also how the readers think about us.

It can also be found on my personal website: https://sites.google.com/view/cynding/projects/hotel-reviews-and-tweets-sentiment-analysis?authuser=1
