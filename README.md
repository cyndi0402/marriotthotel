## Project Overview

Marriott Hotel reviews could be found on the company's official website, TripAdvisor, Expedia, and many more hotel-booking platforms. Potential new customers will usually browse these online reviews and make the decision of whether or not to book a room at the Marriott.

But what if they have already made up their mind after hearing what a friend said? Other than online reviews on hotel-booking platforms, customers could be also influenced by others' opinions on social media, taking tweets and Facebook posts as examples. Understanding how people think about our hotel on mainstream social media will bring us the general public's perception of our hotel.

By conducting sentiment analysis on existing hotel reviews scrapped from the company's official website, I created a model that can quantify on a scale of 1-5, how the author of a tweet on Twitter feels about our hotel, and as a consequence, how the readers may think about us.
